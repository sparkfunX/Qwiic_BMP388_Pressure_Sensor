Qwiic Breakout for the Bosch BMP388 Digital Pressure Sensor. Bosch's BMP388 is a blazingly fast, temperature stable, pinpoint accurate barometric pressure sensor specifically suited for altitude tracking in drone applications. We thought that sounded pretty cool, so we put it on a Qwiic-compatible breakout board to make it easier to prototype with.
